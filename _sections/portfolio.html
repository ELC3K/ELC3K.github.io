	    Developed from 1957 through 1961 to provide French airborne troops with an air-transportable vehicle that could 
            engage heavy tanks. The vehicle mounted a 90-mm gun and had a very low silhouette. The two crew members were seated in the turret, 
            which could turn through 360 degrees, but only when the vehicle was not moving. Variants with different guns were planned. 
            Only one prototype was manufactured. The vehicle never saw service.

	    World of Tanks (WoT) is a massively multiplayer online game developed by Belarusian company Wargaming, featuring mid-20th 
	    century (1930sâ€“1960s) era combat vehicles.[1] It is built upon a freemium business model where the game is free-to-play, 
	    but participants also have the option of paying a fee for use of "premium" features. The focus is on player vs. player 
	    gameplay with each player controlling an armored vehicle.
